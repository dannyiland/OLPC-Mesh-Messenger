name: One Laptop Per Child Mesh Messenger
website: http://www.disasterapp.info
description: Receive Reports and Uploads from people using One Laptop Per Child XO laptops. Messages are passed between XO laptops on an Ad-Hoc network, so a single XO who obtains internet access or leaves an area without internet access can upload many reports from that area. This plugin generates "cures", a notification that a message was received. Each "cure" is used to reduce network congestion and tell everyone in the area the exact time the  message was uploaded to Ushahidi.

== Description ==
Enables a Ushahidi compatibility with OLPC Mesh Messenger, an emergency 
communication activity for OLPC. The core idea
is that when XOs come into Wi-Fi range of each other, they pass
text-based messages back and forth, with the hope that eventually one
XO will gain internet access, and upload all messages on the device to
an Ushahidi crisis map.

== Installation ==
